# Project Title: Image Classification using Neural Networks

Project Description:

I developed a neural network model to classify images using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries. I used a sequential model with two hidden layers and a softmax output layer. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images, and it achieved an accuracy of 89.47% on the validation dataset.

Project Goals:

The goals of this project were to:

Learn how to use Keras and TensorFlow to develop neural network models
Apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem
Improve my understanding of image classification
Project Accomplishments:

I was able to successfully develop a neural network model that was able to classify images with an accuracy of 89.47%. This project helped me to learn how to use Keras and TensorFlow, and it also gave me a better understanding of image classification.
